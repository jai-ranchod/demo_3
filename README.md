# Repository Overview
This github repository is designed to give demonstrations of my expertise in a variety of data science and data analysis contexts using the R, SQL, and Python programming languages.

You can download R here from the Case Western Reserve University mirror here:
https://cran.case.edu/

and you can download the RStudio IDE here:
https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/

Both are free.

The data sets referenced are all built into R.

Birthday Paradox(python):
This files explores the "Birthday Paradox" which states that the probability of having two or more people in the same room with the same birthday exceeds 50% with only 23 people in the room.

Data Visualizations - Titanic Data(R): 
This script uses the built-in "Titanic" data set.  The focus is on data visualizations that illustrate different factors influencing survival rates of the Titanic wreck.

Exponential Forecasting(R):
This script uses a data set from Yahoo Finance that will be referenced directly within the script; no alterations will be necessary.  I use an optimized Holt model to forecast the value of the PHLX semiconductor index 21 business days (one month) out.

KNN - Titanic (R):
This script uses the "titanic_train" data set to illustrate the use of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to create a binary classifier on the survival status of passengers from the infamous Titanic Oceanliner tragedy.

LASSO Regression (R):
Here we use the LASSO regularization technique as applied to a linear model predicting the salaries of baseball players using statistics from the 1986 and 1987 seasons.

Recursive Query - Employee Lineage (SQL):
Here we create a table of employees and managers.  We then use a recursive query to create a table identifying the top level managers and the number of employees under each.

Linear modeling - Cars(R): 
This script uses the "mtcars" data set to illustrate the creation of a linear regression model.  We also analyze the primary assumptions of linear modeling.

Logistic Regression(R):
In this script, we return to the "Titanic" data set to build a logistic regression model.  The "titanic_train" set is used to create the binary predictor model which is then evaluated on the "titanic_test" set.

Principal Component Analysis(R):
In this script, I use the built-in "mtcars" data set to demonstrate principal component analysis as an exploratory analysis technique.

Random Forest modeling(R):
This script contains two random forest models.  One applies to the "mtcars" data set so as to draw a parallel to the linear modeling script.  The other explores the more complex "abalone" data set held in R.

Statistical Analysis - Cancer Statistics(R): 
In this script, I use data from the Cleveland Clinic that is directly referenced in the script, no alterations are necessary.  The analysis focuses on the odds ratios associated with Thyroid cancer for men vs. women, and contains analysis across both time and gender.

SQLite Demo(SQL in R):
This script uses the RSQLite package which embeds an SQLite database engine in R.  I add the tables from the "SQL Practice Problems" book by Sylvia Mosilik.  I then use SQLite to execute the queries that are mey answers to some of the "Intermediate" and "Challenge" problems.  The original code was written in MS SQL, and what you see in this repository is my adaptation to SQLite.  For your reference, please find attached a photo of the database schema.

I look forward to sharing my work with you. There is a lot of information here, so if you would like a pdf with more detailed explanations, or if you have any other questions or comments, please do not hesitate to reach out to me at:
